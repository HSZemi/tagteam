# tagteam
A small helper program for tag team matches

## Setup

- Run the server somewhere and set the right names in its `config.json`
- Adapt the server url in `tagteam.au3` and compile it
- Replace `marco-on.jpg`, `marco-off.jpg`, `polo-on.jpg`, and `polo-off.jpg` with suitable images
- Spectators and pros use the compiled `tagteam.exe` without the ini file
- Noobs each get a special version with a custom `tagteam.ini` which includes their team and the configured secret for their team
